## Governance

We try our best to make decisions in the open through [KEPs](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps) (Kubernetes Enhancement Proposal).
This allows us to have deep and documented discussion in the open with everyone having the chance the voice their opinion.

### KEP vs Issue

In general, if you want to add / change a new major part to fide a KEP is the right place.
For everything else issues are suggested. If an issue uncovers potential bigger changes you might be asked to collaborate on a KEP.
